Hi this is Rahat Rahman and below is my word sort project using threading. To use this you put the word you want to search for in the first argument here: 
t = threading.Thread(target=count_word, args=('the', counter))
You can replace the word 'the' with any word you'd like to search for.
To alter the number of threads you change the range of the loop. If you'd like one thread then you'd put range(1,2), if you'd like eight then you'd put range(1,9)
